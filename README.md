### 2) Clone the configuration

### Debian-Based Installs

```
git clone --branch awesome [url] ~/.config/
```

### 3) Set the themes

Start `lxappearance` to active the **icon** theme and **GTK** theme
Note: for cursor theme, edit `~/.icons/default/index.theme` and `~/.config/gtk3-0/settings.ini`, for the change to also show up in applications run as root, copy the 2 files over to their respective place in `/root`.

Recommended Cursors - <https://github.com/keeferrourke/capitaine-cursors>

Set Rofi Theme
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/rofi
cp $HOME/.config/awesome/theme/config.rasi ~/.config/rofi/config.rasi
sed -i '/@import/c\@import "'$HOME'/.config/awesome/theme/spotlight.rasi"' ~/.config/rofi/config.rasi
```

### 4) Same theme for Qt/KDE applications and GTK applications, and fix missing indicators

First install `qt5-style-plugins` (debian) | `qt5-styleplugins` (arch) and add this to the bottom of your `/etc/environment`

```bash
XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2
```

The first variable fixes most indicators (especially electron based ones!), the second tells Qt and KDE applications to use your gtk2 theme set through lxappearance.

### 5) Read the documentation

The documentation live within the source code.

The project is split in functional directories and in each of them there is a readme where you can get additional information about the them.
